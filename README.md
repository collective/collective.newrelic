Introduction
------------

This package offers instrumentation for NewRelic ( http://www.newrelic.com ). Currently the catalog-tool, transformchains and zope-events are instrumented. A transform is included to support RUM (Real-User-Monitoring): it inserts small snippets of javascript at the top and bottom of the rendered pages. RUM does not work in the ZMI (Zope Management Interface). This currently requires newrelic >= v5.0

Installation
------------

You can add this egg 'collective.newrelic' to your eggs and it will pull in the 'newrelic' egg too.  ::

    [buildout]
    
    # either pin versions as shown below...  
    versions=versions
    
    [versions]
    newrelic = 7.10.0.175
    repoze.xmliter = 0.5
    collective.newrelic = 2.0.0

    # ...or allow picked versions and risk breakage on product updates
    #allow-picked-versions = true
    
    parts +=
        newrelic    

    [newrelic]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts
    eggs = newrelic
    
    [instance]
    eggs +=
        collective.newrelic
    
    # make sure newrelic itself is enabled and set the path to your newrelic.ini file
    environment-vars +=
        NEW_RELIC_ENABLED true
        NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE ${buildout:directory}/newrelic.ini
        NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT development
    
    # when using supervisor, setting environment variables is slightly different:
    #[supervisor]
    #supervisord-environment=NEW_RELIC_ENABLED=true,NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=${buildout:directory}/newrelic.ini,NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT=development

A number of additional settings can optionally be configured using environment variables, see http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-configuration#environment-variables for details.
Customizing your newrelic.ini file is more advised though, see below.

The ``NEW_RELIC_ENABLED`` and ``NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE`` variables need to be set for the newrelic agent to work though. 

Omitting ``NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT`` variable will mean the [newrelic] part is loaded without additional [newrelic:YOURENVNAME] settings.

Please note: the newrelic package needs python >= 2.5. This package will not work on Plone 3.

Use
---

To enable the logging to newrelic.com, create an account at newrelic.com and get your license key. Create a 'newrelic.ini' file in the root of your project. Either by copying the template from this package or the newrelic package or run ::

    $ bin/newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR-LICENSE-KEY newrelic.ini

This will create a newrelic.ini file in the current directory.

You might want to validate your generated file using ``newrelic-admin validate-config newrelic.ini``

The default profile is 'staging', you can use your own via the enviroments variables mentioned above. You can change the default name of 'Python Application (Staging)' in the newrelic.ini file. To get sensible database-traces change ::

    transaction_tracer.record_sql = obfuscated

to ::

    transaction_tracer.record_sql = raw
 

Example usage
=============
In utils you find a few helper functions to wrap (parts) of your products and/or plone and/or any python module.
For example you could make a simple egg called myproduct.newrelic with only an `__init__.py`.
Within that file you have a '''initialize''' function, therein you use the helper functions for further wrapping.

Full class+function wrapping of an entire module
------------------------------------------------
::

    from plone.app import viewletmanager as plone_viewletmanager
    from collective.newrelic.utils import wrap_module_classes_functions
    class_function_modules = [plone_viewletmanager, ]
    wrapped_methods = wrap_module_classes_functions(class_function_modules)
    print len(wrapped_methods)

Single class wrapping 
---------------------
:: 

    from zope.tal.talinterpreter import TALInterpreter
    from collective.newrelic.utils import wrap_class_found_functions
    wrapped_methods = wrap_class_found_functions(TALInterpreter)
    print len(wrapped_methods)

Pin point precision wrapping of single class function
-----------------------------------------------------
::

    from zope.tal.talinterpreter import TALInterpreter
    from collective.newrelic.utils import wrap_class_function
    wrapped_methods = wrap_class_function(TALInterpreter, TALInterpreter.__call__)
    print wrapped_methods
    "TALInterpreter.__call__"


Troubleshooting
===============

If you see a message ``The Python Agent is not enabled.`` in the Zope instance log, first check if ``NEW_RELIC_ENABLED`` environment variable was set correctly. 

If this is ok, check your ``newrelic.ini`` file and make sure the profile you are using (eg ``[newrelic:staging]``) has ``monitor_mode = true``.

It can also mean that the newrelic.ini cannot be found. Make sure the path to your newrelic.ini file is correctly set using the ``NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE`` environment variable.  

If you see a message ``A valid account license key cannot be found.``, check that you have a valid license key and make sure it is correctly set in the ``newrelic.ini`` file.
